## Preperation

Keptn-in-a-Box is a üöÄ rocket launcher for enabling tutorials or workshops in an easy, fast and ressource efficient way.
Keptn-In-A-Box is a Bash script that will convert a plain Ubuntu machine in a Single Node Kubernetes Cluster with Keptn installed and configured 

In a matter of minutes you'll have a fully configured Single Node Kubernetes Cluster for learning Keptn tutorials, trying out new functionalities, building your own pipeline or even delivering Performance-as-a-Self-Service.

Keptn-in-a-Box runs on microk8s, which is a simple production-grade upstream certified Kubernetes made for developers and DevOps.

### How can you access your KIAB instance?

Access your Dynatrace Tenant
Go to Dashboards
open the "‚òÅ Autonomous Cloud Concepts with Keptn" Dashboard.

Select link "üåê KeptnInABox"

Optionally, you can also find the ip address, to the KIAB homepage, by loggining into your EC2 instance.
Then run the following from the command prompt.

```bash
less +F /tmp/install.log
```

Get the URL for KIAB from the log output.

Open a Browser window with the URL.

Welcome to KIAB.

### Validate projects in the keptn bridge

Click on the "Bridge" link. This will open the keptn bridge.
You should see the preloaded projects.

<img src="../../assets/images/bridge01.png" width="400"/>

You may need to run several pipelines to complete the deployments of the applications.
Don't worry, we will walk you through the process.

### Run Pipeline

Click on **"Jenkins"**

Now we will kick off the Pipeline **01-deploy-order-application** to build out the application.

Login to Jenkins with the following credentials

* username = keptn
* password = keptn

After selecting the pipeline click **"build"**

### Order App Overview

This application was built for demonstations of Dynatrace.  The front-end look like this.

<img src="../../assets/images/orders.png" width="300"/>

The overall application is made up of four Docker components: a frontend web UI and 3 backend services.  Once monitored by Dynatrace, a multi-tier call flow will be available such as shown below.

<img src="../../assets/images/dt-call-flow.png" width="500"/>

#### Pre-built Docker Images

The dt-orders application has pre-built problems programmed within different versions.  See source in the [dt-orders repo](https://github.com/dt-orders).  Each version for each service, has pre-built docker images that are published to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dtdemos).

This is a summary of the versions followed by a description of the problem scenarios.

| Service  | Branch/Docker Tag | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| frontend | 1.0.0 | Normal behavior |
| catalog-service | 1.0.0 | Normal behavior |
| customer-service | 1.0.0 | Normal behavior |
| order-service | 1.0.0 | Normal behavior |
| customer-service | 2.0.0 | High Response time for /customer/list.html |
| order-service | 2.0.0 | 50% exception for /order/line URL and n+1 back-end calls for /order/form.html |
| customer-service | 3.0.0 | Normal behavior |
| order-service | 3.0.0 | Normal behavior |

### Problem Scenarios

#### Deploy dtdemos/customer-service:2.0.0

<img src="../../assets/images/usecase1.png" width="500"/>

### Deploy dtdemos/order-service:2.0.0 

Both these scenearios are enabled

<img src="../../assets/images/usecase2.png" width="500"/>

and...

### Examine Dynatrace 

Now lets look at what we have discovered in Dynatrace.

Open Dynatrace and navigate to **Hosts** in the menu and select the host.

Here we can examine all the proceses automatically discovered by the Dynatrace oneAgent.

<img src="../../assets/images/pre_host.png" width="400"/>

We can also see the processes for the order application.

<img src="../../assets/images/pre_processes.png" width="300"/>

Next we can examine the Transactions and Services.

Select **Transactions and Services** from the menu.

<img src="../../assets/images/pre_services.png" width="400"/>

You can also change the focus by using the _management zone_ filter.

Finally, we can also see how the KIAB configured Kubernetes cluster monitoring.

Select **Kubernetes** from the menu.

<img src="../../assets/images/pre_kube.png" width="400"/>

Pre-configured items also include:

1. Dashboards
1. Request Attributes
1. Calculated Service Metrics
1. Management Zones
1. Automatically Applied Tags

Now that we are more familiar with what we have running, let's continue to the next activity.
