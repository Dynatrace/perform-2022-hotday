## Introduction

Welcome to the **Dynatrace for Full-Stack Cloud Platform Teams (App and K8s) lab**.

In this lab we will learn how to deploy Dynatrace OneAgent on the k8s platform to gain full-stack monitoring of all your k8s workload/applications. Plus, see how to integrate k8s clusters with Dynatrace software intelligence platform, so you can gain advanced observability into k8s clustersâ€™ health and k8s events.

Our goals are:

1. **Deploy the Dynatrace Operator**
2. **Deploy our sample application - Sockshop**
3. **Demonstrate full stack monitoring with Dynatrace**
4. **Analyze our Kubernetes Integration**
5. **Deploy and annotate Prometheus exporters to pull additional metrics into Dynatrace**
6. **Create Kubernetes Dashboards to view all of these metrics in a single pane**
7. **Utilize Log Monitoring v2 for Kubernetes logs and events**
