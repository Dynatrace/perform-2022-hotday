## Dynatrace API kit

Dynatrace API is a very powerful tool and can help us achieve so much more outside of Dynatrace UI. We can use it for configuration, deployment, dashboards, metric ingestion, events, etc. In today's session we will help you understand the structure of some of the APIs and how can they be used. Some of these topics will be covered on in this HOT Session, which include:

1. Web Application API
2. App detection rules API
3. Auto Tagging rules API
4. Synthetic API
5. Management zone API
6. Dashboard API
7. Conditional Naming
