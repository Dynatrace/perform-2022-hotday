## WMI Extension

In this exercise, we will create a WMI extension using Extensions 2.0. For this, we will also rely on the OneAgent installed on the machine provided to you.

At the end of this lab, we will have:

1. A built WMI extension
2. A monitoring configuration in Dynatrace
3. WMI data displayed on screens and dashboards
4. A packaged and ready to distribute version
