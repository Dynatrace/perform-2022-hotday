# Here is the definition of our SNMP datasource
# We will have three metrics, sys.uptime, interface.in.octets and interface.out.octets
# We will also have two dimensions, sys.name and interface.name
# Note how this only declares WHAT we want to collect (not WHERE)
# The WHERE comes later and is configured by the user, as a monitoring configuration in Dynatrace
